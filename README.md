### Cybersecurity Student & Practitioner
*Focusing on the intersection of Offensive Security and Network Infrastructure*

### 👋 About Me

I am a passionate and driven cybersecurity student from Portugal, specializing in the intersection of **offensive security** and **deep network infrastructure**. I believe that to truly break a network, you must first understand how to build it. This dual focus is the core of my methodology.

I actively hone these skills by performing penetration tests on platforms like Hack The Box and TryHackMe, while simultaneously building a robust networking foundation through my ongoing Cisco **CCNA** studies. My goal is to begin a career where I can leverage my deep understanding of networking to perform realistic and impactful security assessments, helping organizations secure their core infrastructure from sophisticated threats.

### 💡 My Approach to Security
My methodology is rooted in a simple principle: **break it to build it better**. I am driven by the process of deconstructing complex network environments, identifying the root cause of vulnerabilities, and understanding the attacker's mindset to create more resilient systems.

### 🎯 Key Areas of Interest
* Red Teaming & Threat Emulation
* Network Penetration Testing
* Active Directory Security
* Purple Teaming & Collaborative Defense

### 👨‍💻 Currently Learning
* **Cisco CCNA:** Deepening my foundational knowledge of network routing, switching, and infrastructure security to better understand and exploit network-level vulnerabilities.
* **CTF Platforms (HTB & THM):** Actively solving challenges to keep my practical, hands-on penetration testing skills sharp and up-to-date with current Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs).
